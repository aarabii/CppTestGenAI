# Analysis for Component: Service

### File: `Jwt.h`
- **Summary:** A service class that encodes and decodes JWT tokens using the jwt-cpp library.
- **Testability Score:** {'score': 7, 'justification': 'The class has a constructor and two member functions that can be tested independently. However, the class also uses global variables for storing the secret key and issuer, which could make it difficult to test in isolation.'}
- **Estimated Line Coverage:** 85%
- **Suggested Test Cases:**
  - Test case 1: Verify that the encode method correctly encodes a JWT token.
  - Test case 2: Verify that the decode method correctly decodes a JWT token.
  - Test case 3: Verify that the class throws an exception if the secret key or issuer are not provided.

### File: `JwtPlugin.h`
- **Summary:** This header file defines a class that serves as a plugin for the JWT authentication feature.
- **Testability Score:** {'score': 7, 'justification': "The class is testable because it has a well-defined interface and is composed of independent modules with minimal dependencies. However, some members are not unit-tested, such as the 'config' field."}
- **Estimated Line Coverage:** 85%
- **Suggested Test Cases:**
  - Test case 1: Verify that the init() method properly initializes the JwtPlugin object.
  - Test case 2: Test the shutdown() method to ensure it shuts down the plugin correctly.
  - Test case 3: Check that the config field is properly initialized and set during initialization.
