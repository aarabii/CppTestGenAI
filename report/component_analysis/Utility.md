# Analysis for Component: Utility

### File: `Jwt.cc`
- **Summary:** A utility class for JWT encoding and decoding.
- **Testability Score:** {'score': '10', 'justification': 'The class has no dependencies or tight coupling, making it highly testable.'}
- **Estimated Line Coverage:** 100%
- **Suggested Test Cases:**
  - Test case: Verify that the 'encode' function correctly encodes a JWT token with the given parameters.
  - Test case: Verify that the 'decode' function correctly decodes a JWT token and returns its payload.

### File: `utils.cc`
- **Summary:** Provides helper functions for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Testability Score:** {'score': 8, 'justification': 'The code is structured in a modular fashion, with each function having a single responsibility. Additionally, the dependency injection is used to provide testability.'}
- **Estimated Line Coverage:** 85%
- **Suggested Test Cases:**
  - {'description': 'Test that badRequest() returns an HTTP response with the correct status code and error message.', 'assertions': ["The returned HTTP response has a status code of 'code'", "The returned JSON object contains an 'error' field with value 'err'"]}
  - {'description': 'Test that makeErrResp() returns a JSON object with the correct error message.', 'assertions': ["The returned JSON object contains an 'error' field with value 'err'"]}

### File: `utils.h`
- **Summary:** Provides utility functions for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Testability Score:** {'score': 8, 'justification': 'The file includes a function for handling bad requests with custom error messages, which can be tested by mocking the callback function.'}
- **Estimated Line Coverage:** 85%
- **Suggested Test Cases:**
  - Test that the `badRequest` function correctly sets the HTTP status code and response body for a custom error message.
  - Test that the `makeErrResp` function correctly creates a JSON object with the specified error message.
