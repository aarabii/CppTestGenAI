Here is a comprehensive static code analysis report for the `Jwt.h` file in strict JSON format only:
```json
{
  "file_name": "Jwt.h",
  "component": "Service",
  "summary": "A service class that encodes and decodes JWT tokens using the jwt-cpp library.",
  "testability_score": {
    "score": 7,
    "justification": "The class has a constructor and two member functions that can be tested independently. However, the class also uses global variables for storing the secret key and issuer, which could make it difficult to test in isolation."
  },
  "suggested_test_cases": [
    "Test case 1: Verify that the encode method correctly encodes a JWT token.",
    "Test case 2: Verify that the decode method correctly decodes a JWT token.",
    "Test case 3: Verify that the class throws an exception if the secret key or issuer are not provided."
  ],
  "estimated_line_coverage": "85%",
  "potential_issues": [
    "Global variable usage can cause state leaks during tests."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Refactor the class to use dependency injection for better testability.",
    "Add unit tests to cover the potential issues and exceptions."
  ]
}
```
This report includes the following information:

* File name: `Jwt.h`
* Component: Service (based on the code structure)
* Summary: A one-sentence summary of the core functionality of the file (encodes/decodes JWT tokens)
* Testability score: 7/10 (justification provided in the report)
* Suggested test cases: Three test cases that can be used to verify the functionality of the class (encode, decode, and exception handling)
* Estimated line coverage: 85% (based on the code structure and logic complexity)
* Potential issues: Global variable usage can cause state leaks during tests
* Recommendations: Two recommendations for improving testability and adding unit tests to cover potential issues and exceptions.
