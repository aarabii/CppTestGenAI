This is a C++ code file that contains the implementation of a class `User` that represents a user entity in a web application. The class has several methods that are used to interact with the user, such as setting and getting their username and password, and checking whether they have the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `User` class definition starts with an `class User {`. This marks the beginning of the class declaration.
* The next line defines a constructor for the `User` class that takes two arguments: `username` and `password`. These arguments are stored as private members of the class.
* The `setUsername` method sets the value of the `username` member variable to the passed-in value. This method also checks if the username is not empty or null, and throws an exception if it is.
* The `setPassword` method sets the value of the `password` member variable to the passed-in value. This method also checks if the password is not empty or null, and throws an exception if it is.
* The `getUsername` method returns the current value of the `username` member variable.
* The `getPassword` method returns the current value of the `password` member variable.
* The `checkPermission` method checks whether the user has a certain permission by comparing the passed-in permission with the `permission` member variable, which is an array that contains all the permissions granted to the user. If the user does not have the specified permission, this method will throw an exception.
* The `checkAdminPermissions` method checks whether the user has at least one of the admin permissions by comparing the passed-in permission with the `permission` member variable. If the user does not have any admin permissions, this method will throw an exception.
* The `toString` method returns a string representation of the user, which includes their username and password. This is used for debugging purposes.
* The `main` function is a test driver that creates a new `User` object with a username and password, sets some permissions, and then uses the various methods to check whether the user has the necessary permissions.
