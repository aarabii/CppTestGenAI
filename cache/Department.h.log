"estimated_line_coverage": "90%",
"potential_issues": [
{
"description": "Potential issue: Global variable usage can cause state leaks during tests.",
"justification": "The global variables 'insertColumns()' and 'metaData_' are used in the class definition, which may result in unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies when running unit tests."
}
],
"recommendations": [
{
"description": "Recommendation: Refactor the code to use a factory pattern for creating objects instead of hardcoding all dependencies.",
"justification": "The class definition currently hardcodes the dependencies on 'drogon::orm::Mapper<Department>' and 'drogon::orm::DbClient', which may make it difficult to test or change the code in the future."
},
{
"description": "Recommendation: Implement a custom constructor for the Department class that takes an existing DbClient object as a parameter.",
"justification": "The current constructor creates a new DbClient object, which may not be desirable when testing or running the code in a distributed environment."
